# Beer Journal w/ Electron (March 7th, 2017)

## Let's ensure Electron is up and running
`npm run start`

## Fire up .NET core api and mongo db @see [dot-net-st-pete-api](https://github.com/johnrhampton/dot-net-st-pete-api/blob/master/README.md)

Let's open up Postman to create a new user and login to our application.

If we attempt to login with bad credentials, or no credentials, the app will notify us.

Once we successfully login, we can add new beer journal entries and see all our previous entries.

# Beer Journal w/ Electron (March 7th, 2017)

Welcome to **Building a Beer Journal w/ Electron, .NET Core, and MongoDB**! In this presentation we will build an Electron application with simple authorization against a .NET core API.  We will be able to create new beer journal entries, and edit / review existing entries.

This presentation will be focused on Mac OS.

By the end of this presentation, you will have:

* Installed all required Electron dependencies
* Initialized a new Electron project
* Run and Debug an Electron app
* Wired up simple authentication against a .NET core API
* Added react-scripts to Electron for webpack-dev-server support, HMR, and other goodies
* Added a native menu
* Displayed native notifications
* Displayed JS based notifications
* Used React w/ Electron to present data
* Used Material Design for examples of basic styling (may not make sense on desktop - but good example)
* Persisted a Beer Journal Entry in MongoDB
* Displayed a Beer Journal Entry with React
